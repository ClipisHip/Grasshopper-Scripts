# SCREWS GENERATOR — SPEC

Four paste-in Grasshopper C# components that share one placement convention and
one thread profile, so their output mates.

    ScrewGenerator.cs   the screw  +  the hole prep for the part it passes through
    ThreadTap.cs        the internal thread for the part it screws INTO
    NutGenerator.cs     the nut  +  the pocket that captures it
    NutOpts.cs          builds NutGenerator's Opts string out of sliders
    ScrewOptions.cs     every valid string as a LIST, plus material presets

    OPTIONS.md          every option written out, with the dimension charts
    RECOMMENDATIONS.md  what to set for PLA, resin, aluminium, and why

Wire ONE plane into both `Pln` inputs and the screw lands in its own hole, head
bearing on the face. Wire `ScrewGenerator.Spec` into `ThreadTap.Spec` and the
nut side inherits the size, the hand, the tolerance and the segment count. That
is the whole workflow.

## 0. THE FRAME, BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE DEPENDS ON IT

    Pln.Origin is the PART FACE, and the mouth of the tapped hole. Both scripts
    drive along -Pln.ZAxis.

       socket · button · hex · pan            flat (countersunk)

         +Z   [][]  head                       ____       ____

               \ /  45 deg point                \ /

              the head bears its              the head sits IN the face,
              underside on the face           so Pln is the head TOP

    LENGTH FOLLOWS THE SAME SPLIT, and it is the trade convention, not a choice:
    under the head for everything except `flat`, where it is the TOTAL length
    with the head included. Which means two flat heads of the same Length line
    up at the top and reach the same depth, however much their head heights
    differ — and M6 and 1/4-20 differ by more than a millimetre, because 82 deg
    is shallower than 90 and the inch head is wider.

    Prep is built in the same frame. The clearance bore runs DOWN from the plane.
    A counterbore or countersink runs UP from it — that is the material you take
    off to seat the head, so for those two settings part of Prep pokes above the
    plane. That is correct, not a bug.

## 2. THREAD TAP                                                (ThreadTap.cs)

    INPUTS      Spec        string   ScrewGenerator's Spec output, or a bare size.
                                     Carries size, hand, tol and seg, so this
                                     component needs none of them of its own.
                                     Full form: M5 hand=R tol=0.20 seg=96 class=6H
                Length      double   depth of thread
                OuterDia    double   outside of the Nut boss, 0 = auto (2 d)
                Tol         double   clearance OVERRIDE. Leave at 0 to use what
                                     Spec brought; set a number to overrule it.
                Chamfer     double   mouth funnel, IN PITCHES not mm. 0.5 to cut
                                     metal, 1 to print, 0 for none. ThreadTap
                                     multiplies by its own pitch, so one number
                                     suits every size.
                Pln         Plane
    OUTPUTS     Cutter      Brep     SUBTRACT from your part -> tapped hole
                Nut         Brep     cylindrical boss with the hole already in it
                Drill       Brep     tap-drill hole: cylinder + 118 deg point
                Info        string

    SIX INPUTS, NOT NINE. Size, Class, Threads and Segments all used to be here
    and all four now ride in on `Spec`. Typing a bare "M5" still works — the rest
    fall back to right hand, 6H, 96 segments and whatever `Tol` you set.

    CLASS DOES LESS THAN YOU THINK. A solid is one size, not a tolerance band, so
    only the fundamental deviation — where the band STARTS — can show up in the
    geometry. ISO 965-1 gives position H an EI of 0, so 6H, 7H and "nominal" are
    the same solid; the grade number only says how much bigger the hole may get.
    Position G is EI = +(15 + 11P) micrometres on diameter. Unified inch classes
    1B / 2B / 3B all sit on EI = 0, so on the inch side Class does nothing at all.

    WHICH MEANS TOL IS THE FIT. It opens every thread radius, so the hole grows
    by 2 x Tol on diameter.

            machining, real tap        0
            resin / SLA                0.05 - 0.10
            FDM, tuned                 0.15 - 0.20
            FDM, first try             0.25

    At Tol 0 and class H you get the BASIC profile — which is a zero-clearance
    fit against a nominal screw. Right for a Boolean, will not print.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2b. NUT GENERATOR                                          (NutGenerator.cs)

    INPUTS      Spec        string   ScrewGenerator's Spec, or a bare size.
                                     Carries size, hand, tol and seg, same as
                                     it does into ThreadTap.
                Type        string   hex | thin | nylock | nylock-thin
                                     | square | square-thin
                Entry       string   top | side | none
                Tol         double   clearance override, 0 = inherit from Spec.
                                     Opens the pocket per flat AND the nut's
                                     own thread on the radius.
                Opts        string   sink= slot= bore= af= h= chamfer=
                Pln         Plane    the face the pocket opens on
    OUTPUTS     Nut         Brep     the nut (plain bore if Spec says hand=none)
                Prep        Brep     pocket + bolt bore, DIFFERENCE it out
                Info        string

    THE POCKET IS THE POINT. A real steel nut costs pennies and will not strip,
    which makes a captive nut the best answer in plastic at any size — and the
    only answer below M5, where a printed thread has no flank left (see
    RECOMMENDATIONS, "Tol is absolute"). Entry says how it gets in:

        top    open at the face, drop it in
        side   slot out to the edge, slide it in.  Rotate Pln to aim it.
        none   nut sits ON the face; Prep is only the bolt bore
        side + slot=0   roofed pocket, no way in: pause the print and drop it
                        in.  Info tells you the height to pause at.

    The hex has a corner on +X, so across-flats is the width of the side slot
    and the nut slides straight in.

    ISO vs DIN. M10, M12 and M14 come in two across-flats — 16/18/21 to ISO and
    17/19/22 to DIN 934, which is much of what is actually sold. A pocket for
    one will not take the other. Measure the nut and set af= in Opts. Info says
    so on those sizes, and names which family the Type you picked belongs to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. THE THREAD

    Both scripts draw the same zig-zag. It is the ISO 68-1 / ASME B1.1 BASIC
    profile, and it is genuinely one line: the external thread keeps the material
    inside it, the internal thread keeps it outside.

        H  = 0.86603 P            height of the fundamental triangle
        major   d                 crest of the screw / root of the nut, flat P/8
        minor   d - 1.0825 P      root of the screw / crest of the nut, flat P/4
        pitch   d - 0.6495 P
        flanks  60 deg included, so 30 deg off the axis

    The SCREW is drawn at basic nominal, no allowance. It is the reference part.
    All clearance lives on the other side: Fit + Tol in Prep, and Tol in
    ThreadTap. A real 6g screw is about 0.02 mm under basic — below any printer's
    noise floor, and if you care, add it to Tol on the mating side.

    HOW IT IS BUILT, AND WHY THERE IS NO BOOLEAN IN IT

    Cut a screw with a plane perpendicular to its axis and the section is a
    closed curve — the profile wrapped once around, because one turn is exactly
    one pitch and the profile repeats every pitch. Nothing jumps. So the whole
    threaded shank is that one section swept up a helix, and every point of the
    section traces a CONSTANT-RADIUS HELIX as it goes.

    That is what the code builds: one `NurbsCurve.CreateSpiral` per sample of the
    profile, then a ruled surface between each neighbouring pair. The rails are
    exact helices, so there is no approximation along the length at all — length
    costs nothing. The only error is faceting the profile, and at 96 samples that
    is 0.0013 mm on an M5 crest.

    It also means the tapers come free. A rail can start at one radius and finish
    at another, so the point chamfer, the thread run-out under the head and the
    lead-in on a tapped hole are just zones with different end radii. Zones share
    their boundary curves exactly, so the skin JOINS.

    `seg` (in Opts, default 96) is snapped to a multiple of 16 so the five breakpoints
    (1/16, 3/8, 5/8, 15/16 of a pitch) land on samples instead of being rounded
    off. 96 is plenty. 32 is a draft. 192 is for renders.

    The ONE Boolean in either script is the hex socket or slot in the head, and
    it only ever touches the head.

    Handedness is measured, not assumed: both scripts build a probe spiral, work
    out which way RhinoCommon wound it, and mirror at the end if that is not what
    you asked for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. THE DATABASE

    Metric M1.6 - M24, inch #0 - 1". Any fine pitch works by writing it out —
    "M10x1.25", "1/4-28" — the head and clearance data comes from the nominal
    size and only the pitch changes.

    WRITING THE SIZE. Leading "M" and a digit means metric; anything else is
    read as inch. Case and a trailing UNC / UNF are ignored.

        M5  M2.5  M24            coarse pitch from the table
        M8x1  M10x1.25           any fine pitch, written out
        1/4-20  3/8-24  1/2-13   fraction and tpi
        #8-32  8-32  #10-24      gauge number, with or without the #
        1/4  3/8                 no tpi given -> UNC
        0.25-20                  a decimal diameter works too

    One trap, handled: "1-8" is the ONE INCH bolt, but "1-64" is the #1 gauge
    screw, and neither writes a "#". The tpi settles it — #1 comes in 64 and 72,
    and nothing an inch across is finer than 20 — so anything under 40 tpi on a
    bare "1" is read as one inch. Write "#1" if you want the gauge size.

    nuts        metric          hex ISO 4032, thin ISO 4035, nylock ISO 7040,
                                nylock-thin DIN 985, square DIN 557,
                                square-thin DIN 562

    EXTRAPOLATED, and the script says so in Info when you land on one:
        metric button head above M16
        metric pan head above M10
        the 1" inch pan row, since B18.6.3 stops at 3/4
    Those rows carry the same ratios as the sizes that ARE tabulated. Everything
    else is off a published table.

    THE COUNTERSUNK HEAD IS MODELLED SHALLOWER THAN THE STANDARD, on purpose.
    ISO 10642 lists M5 as dk 10, k 2.8; a pure 90 deg cone from dk 10 down to the
    5 mm shank is only 2.5 tall. The standard's extra 0.3 is the blend at the
    bottom of the cone, which a cone cannot have. Head DIAMETER and head ANGLE
    are what decide where a screw seats, and both are exact — so a real ISO 10642
    screw sits flush in the countersink this makes. Check the Info report for the
    k it actually used.

## 6. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

    "not watertight"        raise seg= in Opts, or loosen the model tolerance.
                            Rhino's default 0.001 mm is tight for a 96-sided
                            helical skin on a long screw.
    it crawls               turns x seg is the cost. A 40 mm M3 at seg=192 is
                            26 000 samples per rail set. Use seg=48 while you
                            lay the model out, raise it to bake.
    screw will not go in    Tol on the ThreadTap side, not the screw side.
    head sinks too far      Recess, and sink= in Opts. Not Length.
    thread winds backwards  Threads 2. The script measures its own handedness,
                            so 1 is right hand on every Rhino build.
